This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.20.

Create custom playwright reporter, which provide documentation (md files), based on test suites. 
Use these files as a starting point:
app.spec.ts, app2.spec.ts, custom-annotation-types.enum.ts

Result of this reporter should be provided in the `report` folder and keep nesting path structure of the test files.
Each test suite should have its own file in the `report` folder.

Use typescript for the reporter implementation.
